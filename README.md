## Fancy going mining in your hardcore world without looking over your shoulder? Or making a trip to the nether without being swarmed by Piglins?

### Grab your favorite armour and head to that enchantment table! 

Find some new enchantments, one for every hostile mob! These enchantments make their allocated mob passive! So long as you do not attack them, they stay passive! 

## Players can finally experience a world where hostile mobs can become passive.

### Walk freely past a Zombie, never fear a Creeper's hiss

Players will get to experience their worlds in a fun different aspect and be able to walk among the caves freely when using these enchantments if they stay passive themselves. Just do not go into the caves before putting on your armour. Some mobs will remember you are the enemy!

## BEWARE THE CURSE!!
### A new curse has been added to the game! So beware!
Gain this curse and passive mobs will also target you! This includes Chickens, Pigs, Sheep, Cows, and many more to come!
